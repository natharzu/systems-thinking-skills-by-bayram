description: Diagnose a hard problem by building an evidence-graded "Why Tree" - a Goldratt Current-Reality Tree that fans many AI agents across the problem's branch-space, grades every node by the kind of evidence behind it, refutes the weak branches, and converges on the ONE system constraint plus the cheapest test that would prove it. Use when someone asks "why is X happening / why are we falling short of a goal", wants a root-cause analysis with real rigor (not a 5-minute 5-Whys), needs to find the real bottleneck before spending build effort, or asks to "stress-test our diagnosis" / "build a current-reality tree". Bilingual triggers: "почему мы не достигаем цели", "построй дерево текущей реальности", "найди настоящее узкое место". Pairs with /constraint-finder, which returns the 5 Focusing Steps once the constraint is located. Token-heavy by design (multi-agent) - it warns and asks for a depth before launching, and only earns its cost when one careful pass could confidently pick the WRONG cause.
argument-hint: [the problem as a gap-vs-goal + any data/files the agents may read, or "interview me"]

# Why Tree

A **Why Tree** is 5-Whys grown up. Naive root-causing follows a single thread, stops at the first plausible cause, and cites nothing. A Why Tree (Goldratt's Current-Reality Tree) does the opposite: it **searches the whole branch-space in parallel**, **grades every node by the evidence actually behind it**, **tries to refute its own load-bearing branches**, and **converges on the ONE constraint** that, if removed, unblocks everything else - plus the negative branches (fixes that backfire) and the single cheapest test that would fork-decide the conclusion.

The output is a **self-contained interactive HTML tree** + a one-page **decision doc** (constraint located / do this / don't do that / cheapest test).

This rigor costs tokens - the deep pass runs ~25-30 agents. The skill is **transparent about that cost and gates on a depth choice before launching** (Phase 0). Do not skip the gate.

## What makes it different from a normal root-cause analysis (read first)

1. **Branch-space first, depth second.** Map *all* the candidate "why"s from many independent lenses before deepening any one. A single-thread analysis finds the first cause; a tree finds the real one.
2. **Every node is graded.** Each node carries an **answer-kind** (is this MEASURED, an INSTANCE, EXTERNAL, a CLAIM, an INFERENCE, a HYPOTHESIS, or just FRAMING?) + a **confidence grade** + a **citation**. Ungraded assertions are banned. See `references/answer-kinds.md`.
3. **Refute before you trust.** Load-bearing branches face an adversarial pass that tries to kill them. Branches that die are marked REFUTED/DOWNGRADED *with the evidence that killed them* - kept visible, not deleted (they're the most useful part).
4. **Converge to ONE.** Goldratt: there is one constraint; everything else is noise. The tree forces convergence to 3-5 roots and names the single system constraint - often a **policy/ownership** problem wearing a tooling costume.
5. **Honest census.** If the decisive nodes are still HYPOTHESIS (unmeasured), the tree says so out loud: "a map of where to look, not a verdict."

If you find yourself shipping five co-equal "root causes," a tidy single-thread chain, or a confident verdict built on unmeasured nodes - you did it wrong.

---

## Phase 0 - Frame the apex + the token-cost gate (do not skip)

**(a) Sharpen the apex.** State the problem as ONE undesirable effect — a **declarative STATEMENT of the bad thing**, ideally a gap-vs-goal: *"Too few X vs the N target by <date>"*, *"Free→paid conversion is below T"*. **Not a question** ("Can we evaluate X?" / "Why is conversion low?") — a question can't have children that read as "…because…", which breaks the whole "why" chain. Keep any question as a title; the apex *node* is the statement. The apex is itself a FRAMING node - it's a hypothesis about what the real problem is, and the tree may reframe it. Push back if the apex is a solution in disguise ("why don't we have feature Y" is a smuggled answer, not a problem). Also reframe a **measurement / "how many" question** ("how many X, how relevant, how many meetings?") into the underlying gap or decision ("can we evaluate ROI of Y - and what's the constraint?"); the counts are *evidence* (Phase 1), not the apex. Don't build a tree on a pure data-pull.

**First — does this problem even need the skill?** A blind head-to-head ablation (3 problems) found that on a **clear-cut** problem a single agent *beat* the full workflow at ~1/50th the cost. The machinery only earns itself when **one mind can confidently go wrong**: cohort/measurement traps, several plausible roots competing, a buildable mechanism hidden under a symptom, or more branches/evidence than one context can hold. **If the answer is likely legible to one careful pass, say so and answer it directly — do not run the workflow.** (This is why Quick mode was removed: for a cheap sketch, a single agent dominates it.)

**(b) Pick a depth - and state the cost plainly.** Present these two and **wait for an explicit choice**. Describe scale by agent-count and breadth, never by time:

| Depth | Agents (approx) | What it does | When |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|------|
| **Standard** | ~20-36 | 6-lens branch map + grade every node + one refute pass + converge to one constraint + **drill the constraint branch to bedrock**. | The default for a real, confusable decision. |
| **Deep** | ~30-55 | Adds loop-until-dry discovery, a 3-vote multi-lens refute panel, full CLR audit, cheapest-test design, + the constraint drill. The exhaustive pass. | High-stakes, contested, oversized, expensive-to-get-wrong. |

(Agent count = lenses + deepen + **refute fan-out (the multiplier)** + converge + drill; see the blueprint's cap arithmetic. Older "~12-16 / ~25-30" figures predate the caps + drill step.) **Observed cost: ~50k output tokens per agent** - so Standard ≈ 1.0-1.8M, Deep ≈ 1.5-2.7M. State explicitly, e.g.: *"Deep runs ~30-55 subagents and consumes a large number of tokens (~2M+). Confirm before I launch."* Never launch Deep without confirmation; if running headless/delegated with a pre-granted "depth+cost authorized", proceed without pausing. The hard caps (`MAX_DEEPEN`/`MAX_REFUTE`) bound the worst case — an early uncapped run spawned **171 agents** and the blowup rate-limited and *degraded its own refute pass* — so the caps are a correctness guard, not just cost. If the user gave a token budget (a "+Nk" directive), scale depth to it.

**(c) Confidentiality check.** If the source evidence is a client's private data, ask whether the output may name them. Default to an anonymized tree.

---

## Phase 1 - Inventory the evidence sources

Before launching, enumerate what the research agents may actually read - this determines how much of the tree can be MEASURED vs left as HYPOTHESIS:

- **Web** - Exa (`mcp__exa__*`, `mcp__exa-research__*`) and/or the `firecrawl` skill for competitive/external facts, market data, public docs.
- **Local files / data the user names** - a folder, a CSV/JSON export, prior reports, transcripts, DB query results. Ask for paths.
- **Live data** - if a DB or API is reachable and the user authorizes it, agents can run their own reads (this is what produced the "6/6 sends had a signer" refutation in the source case).
- **Prior runs (anti-contamination)** - if a previous Why Tree exists for the SAME problem, you may reuse its **frozen evidence brief** (the Phase-1 facts), but do NOT read its decision-doc / tree / verdict. Reading the prior *conclusion* anchors the lenses and leaks (a converge agent once copied "171 agents" from a prior doc straight into its output). Re-derive from evidence, never from the old answer.

**Compute the hard metrics FIRST.** For data-grounded problems, actually pull/compute the key numbers in Phase 1 (run the query, read the files) and pass them into the workflow as a **frozen evidence brief** with "do NOT re-query". This grounds nodes as MEASURED instead of HYPOTHESIS, and stops N parallel agents from re-hammering the same DB/API. Pull shared/expensive evidence ONCE.

**Measurable-in-hand gate (do not skip).** Before any node is graded HYPOTHESIS or CLAIM, ask: *"would one more query/read over evidence I have ALREADY pulled settle this?"* If yes, it is **not** a HYPOTHESIS — run the check and grade it MEASURED. A node that is cheaply measurable from in-hand data but left unmeasured is a worse failure than a genuinely-external unknown, and they must not be lumped together. Split the "(verify first)" tag into **(one query on data in hand)** vs **(needs new external data)** — only the latter is a legitimate cheapest-test; the former you just *do*.

**Distribution-behind-threshold rule.** Whenever you compute a funnel step as a *threshold* (≥N, hit-the-wall, activated, churned), also pull the **distribution** of the underlying quantity before making any causal claim about why people don't cross it. "83% never hit the 50-lead wall" is silent on whether they died at 5 leads or 48 — opposite diagnoses with opposite fixes. A threshold count may not carry a causal claim the distribution would overturn.

Write a one-line **measurability note**: *"X and Y are queryable; the decisive number Z is not in any source we have - it will stay HYPOTHESIS and become the #1 cheapest-test."* This honesty is the point - it tells the user what the tree can and cannot settle.

---

## Phase 2 - Run the Workflow (the engine)

Use the **Workflow tool** with the blueprint in `references/workflow-template.md`. The shape (scaled by the chosen depth):

1. **Branch-space fan-out** (`parallel()` barrier) - one agent per **lens**, each blind to the others, each emitting candidate WHY-branches under the apex. Lenses: funnel/mechanics · data-skeptic (audit the numbers) · competitive/external · customer-psychology/segments · economics/incentives · product-eng-constraint. More lenses = wider net.
2. **Dedup + bucket** (plain code, not an agent) - merge overlapping branches; bucket into journey **stages** + a **cross-cutting** group.
3. **Deepen + grade** (`pipeline()` per branch) - recursively ask "why does this happen?" **loop-until-dry** to bedrock (Deep) or one level (Standard); attach **answer-kind + confidence + citation** to every node using `references/answer-kinds.md`. Research agents pull evidence from Phase-1 sources here. **Cap the fan-out** (`MAX_DEEPEN`) — dedup first, rank by load-bearing, then drop the tail (and `log()` what was dropped).
4. **Adversarial refute** (perspective-diverse `parallel()`) - for each load-bearing branch, independent skeptics each try to *refute* it from a distinct angle (data-says-otherwise / mechanism-broken / survivorship / mis-attribution). A branch that ≥half refute is marked **REFUTED** or **DOWNGRADED**, keeping the killing evidence.
5. **Converge** - **group** surviving branches into **3-5 root causes** (group ≠ flatten — keep each branch's `children[]` chain intact under its root); locate **THE single system constraint** (if removed, the most branches unblock). The constraint root **must carry the full apex→bedrock why-chain as nested `children[]`** — a childless constraint root is the flat-funnel bug (the rendered output must be a multi-level *tree*, not a 3-band apex→roots→constraint funnel). A final **"drill constraint"** step re-expands that one branch to bedrock if converge flattened it. Flag whether the constraint is **policy/ownership** vs **tooling**. Apply the Evaporating-Cloud check if it's a goal-conflict (see `references/methodology.md`).
6. **Negative branches + cheapest tests** - name fixes that would backfire (NEGATIVE), and the 1-3 reads that would most change the conclusion (rank by: cost to get × how much it moves the verdict).
7. **Emit structured tree JSON** - the contract for the visualization (strict schema in `references/workflow-template.md`): `apex` (a SHORT undesirable-effect **STATEMENT**, ≤140 chars — NOT a question, NOT the answer), `verdict` (the one-line answer), `stages[].nodes[]` (with `id/text/kind/grade/role/cite/children`), `roots[]` (**each with a nested `children[]` causal chain — REQUIRED and non-empty on the constraint root**), `constraint`, `negatives[]`, `tests[]`, `census`. Tag any test/recommendation that rests on an un-refuted CLAIM/HYPOTHESIS node with "(verify first)".

**Phrasing (this is what makes the tree readable as a "why" chain):** every node — `apex`, every `root[].title`, every node `text` — is a **declarative problem/cause STATEMENT** that reads as an answer to "why" of its parent. *"Ad spend is never captured"*, not the topic label *"Cost denominator"*; *"We can't attribute DMs to ads"*, not the bucket *"DM stage"*. **Stages are an analysis scaffold for grouping evidence**, not causal claims — the rendered funnel is **problem → root causes → constraint** and stage names become only context tags, so never rely on a stage label to carry causal meaning. **Never make a "stage" for the apex / verdict / framing itself** — that content IS the apex statement + verdict, not a cause bucket (a stage titled "Apex" or "framing" is a generation bug). Keep `role` within the controlled vocabulary; don't invent roles like "apex-answer".

Save the JSON to disk (e.g. `why-tree-output.json`) before visualizing, so a failed render never loses the analysis.

---

## Phase 3 - Visualize (invoke `frontend-design`)

Render the tree JSON into a **single self-contained HTML file** using `assets/tree-template.html` as the scaffold. **Invoke the `frontend-design` skill** for the aesthetic pass - this is the user's explicit ask: the visualization must be distinctly designed, not the GitHub-default look of the original artifact.

Requirements the visualization must hit:
- **A prominent one-line `verdict`** rendered under the apex (the answer; the apex is just the question).
- **Collapsible, evidence-rich nodes** that stay readable at 25+ nodes (indented disclosure tree, expand/collapse-all).
- **Per-node chips**: answer-kind (color-coded), confidence grade, role badge (ROOT / CONSTRAINT / LEVER / NEGATIVE / REFUTED / DOWNGRADED), and the citation on expand.
- **A constraint "spotlight"** - the single system constraint is visually unmistakable.
- **A convergence map** - a compact branches -> roots -> ONE-constraint diagram (SVG or styled flow), so the "everything funnels to one thing" claim is *seen*, not just asserted.
- **The constraint branch must render as a multi-LEVEL chain, not a single box.** The constraint root carries a nested `children[]` why-chain (apex → because → because → … → bedrock); the spine must show those levels expanded/drillable **in the funnel itself**, not hide them in a side rail. A constraint box with no visible chain beneath it reproduces the "1-level-deep" bug — the whole point is that the eye can follow the chain down to bedrock.
- **Panels**: root causes, negative branches, cheapest tests, and the **evidence census** ("~X% MEASURED, but the decisive Y% is HYPOTHESIS"). **Normalize the census to sum to 1.0** before drawing the bar (a 0.92 sum leaves a cosmetic empty sliver).
- Self-contained, opens on double-click, survives being emailed. A `<!-- TWEAK ZONE -->` for last-mile label edits. (To screenshot during dev, serve via `python3 -m http.server` — chrome `navigate` mangles a raw `file://` path.)

Keep `assets/tree-template.html` as the reusable scaffold (data swapped via an inline JSON block); write each run to its own output file.

---

## Phase 4 - Verify (the CLR audit, non-negotiable)

Before showing anyone, audit the tree (Goldratt's "Categories of Legitimate Reservation"):
- **Contradiction check** - does any branch contradict another? Resolve or surface the tension explicitly.
- **One-constraint check** - is exactly ONE system constraint named? If five things are all "critical," convergence failed - send it back.
- **Causality vs correlation** - for each MEASURED->cause arrow, is the cause sufficient, or is there a hidden third factor? Mark INFERENCE honestly.
- **Evidence-honesty census** - compute the answer-kind mix. If the constraint-locating nodes are HYPOTHESIS, the headline must be "where to look," and the cheapest-test must target exactly those nodes.
- **Refutation survived** - every load-bearing branch must show it faced (and survived) the adversarial pass.
- **Multi-level check** - the constraint root must carry a non-empty nested `children[]` chain down to bedrock. A childless constraint root is the flat-funnel bug — send it back to the drill step.
- **Measurable-in-hand check** - is any *decisive* node graded HYPOTHESIS/CLAIM that one query over already-pulled data would settle? If so, run it now and re-grade; don't ship a free check as a "cheapest test."

---

## Phase 5 - Output

Deliver two things:
1. **The interactive tree** (the HTML).
2. **A one-page decision doc** (markdown + matching HTML if the user reviews in HTML per their convention): *Constraint located -> What to do -> What NOT to do (the negative branches) -> The single cheapest test that would fork-decide.* The tree is the diagnosis; the doc is the "so what."

State the headline honestly: if the system constraint is located but the funnel/mechanism constraint is not, say both - "the policy constraint is settled and needs no more data; the mechanism constraint is unlocated and one query would pin it."

---

## Guardrails

1. **Token honesty first** - never launch Deep without an explicit cost warning and confirmation. The gate is the skill's conscience.
2. **One constraint, not a list** - refuse to ship five co-equal roots. Force convergence to one.
3. **Grade every node** - no ungraded assertions; every HYPOTHESIS must name the test that would settle it.
4. **Refute before trust** - load-bearing branches must survive an adversarial pass, and the dead branches stay visible.
5. **Honest census** - when the decisive nodes are unmeasured, say "map, not verdict." Confident verdicts on HYPOTHESIS nodes are the worst output.
6. **Don't smuggle the answer into the apex** - a problem framed as a missing solution biases the whole tree.

## Anti-patterns

- A single-thread 5-Whys chain with a tidy bottom (no branching, no refutation = not a tree).
- Nodes asserted without an answer-kind or citation.
- "Five key root causes" with no convergence to one constraint.
- A confident recommendation resting on HYPOTHESIS-graded nodes, with no census disclosing it.
- Deleting refuted branches instead of keeping them with their killing evidence.
- Launching the deep workflow without telling the user it's token-heavy.
- **Running the full workflow on a clear-cut problem a single agent would nail** - the ablation shows that's wasted tokens; answer it directly and skip the gate.
- **A flat apex → roots → constraint funnel with childless roots** - the constraint branch must be a visible multi-level chain to bedrock, or it's not a tree.
- An uncapped fan-out (no `MAX_DEEPEN`/`MAX_REFUTE`) - it balloons agent count and rate-limit-degrades the refute pass.
- A GitHub-default-looking tree - the visualization is a deliverable; run it through `frontend-design`.
